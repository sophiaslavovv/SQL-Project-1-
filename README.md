<u>Problem Description:</u>
Pretend you are the owner/operator of a RUNNING association (club)
needing to build a relational database. You hired some students from the MIST 4610 class at
the University of Georgia to create the database for you. They need to know more about your
organization to identify which entities, attributes, and relationships are important for you.
Start by describing your business as a real client.

<u>CHATGPT Response:</u>
As the owner/operator of a running club, our organization is dedicated to promoting health, fitness, and community through the sport of running. We provide a variety of services and activities tailored to runners of all ages and abilities, fostering a supportive environment where individuals can pursue their running goals and connect with like-minded enthusiasts.

Here's a snapshot of our running club:

Group Runs: We organize regular group runs at various locations, including trails, parks, and urban routes, catering to different distances and paces. These group runs serve as opportunities for members to train together, socialize, and enjoy the camaraderie of fellow runners.

Coaching and Training Programs: Our club offers coaching services and structured training programs led by experienced coaches and trainers. These programs are designed to help runners improve their performance, set and achieve personal goals, and stay motivated through structured workouts and personalized guidance.

Events and Races: We host and participate in various running events and races throughout the year, including fun runs, charity races, and competitive events. These events provide members with opportunities to challenge themselves, showcase their skills, and engage in friendly competition within the running community.

Workshops and Seminars: We organize educational workshops, seminars, and guest speaker events covering topics such as nutrition, injury prevention, race strategy, and mental preparation. These events offer valuable insights and resources to help runners enhance their training and overall well-being.

Community Engagement: Our club actively engages with the local community through outreach initiatives, volunteer opportunities, and partnerships with schools, businesses, and other organizations. We seek to promote the benefits of running, encourage participation in physical activity, and support charitable causes aligned with our mission.

Membership: We offer membership options with various benefits, including access to club resources, discounts on coaching services and merchandise, priority registration for events, and exclusive member-only activities.

Equipment and Gear: Our club may provide access to equipment and gear, such as running apparel, shoes, hydration packs, and safety accessories, either through partnerships with vendors or through a club-owned inventory.

Given this overview, the database should encompass key entities such as Members, Coaches, Events, Races, Training Programs, Workshops, Community Partnerships, Equipment, and Transactions, along with their associated attributes and relationships to effectively manage club operations, member registrations, event planning, coaching services, and inventory tracking.

Queries:
#1 Show me runners participated in races between january and february:

USE al_Group_21482_G1;
SELECT r.RunnerFirstName, r.RunnerLastName
FROM Runners r
JOIN RaceRegistration rr ON r.idRunners = rr.Runners_idRunners
JOIN Races ra ON rr.Races_idRaces = ra.idRaces
WHERE ra.rDate BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-04-28';


Tracking runners who participated in races during a specific time period can help in monitoring their performance over time. Coaches, athletes, and enthusiasts can gain insights into the progress of individual runners by analyzing their race times, improvements, and consistency.

#2 How many runners does each coach have?

SELECT Coaches.CoachFN, Coaches.CoachLN, COUNT(Runners.idRunners) AS NumberOfRunners
FROM Coaches
LEFT JOIN Runners ON Coaches.idCoaches = Runners.Coaches_idCoaches
GROUP BY Coaches.CoachFN, Coaches.CoachLN;

Shows which coaches have the most runners in descending order; used for determining popularity of coaches.The number of runners under each coach allows the company to monitor the performance of coaches in terms of their ability to attract and retain runners.

#3 How many transactions were made at each individual store?

Select sLocation, COUNT(Transactions.TransactionID) AS NumberOfTransactions
FROM Transactions
JOIN Stores on Stores.StoreID=Transactions.Stores_StoreID
GROUP BY sLocation
ORDER BY NumberOfTransactions DESC;


The transaction data from each store can tell how popular each store was,it  identifies where the most purchases are being made and where the least purchases are made.Transaction data can be used to forecast future sales and plan inventory levels accordingly. The data can provide information to plan for customer behavior and preferences towards products.


#4 Report the names of a runner who have a distance higher than their own average distance.


Select RunnerFirstName, RunnerLastName, Distance
From Runners
JOIN RaceRegistration ON Runners.idRunners= RaceRegistration.Runners_idRunners
JOIN Races ON RaceRegistration.Races_idRaces= Races.idRaces
WHERE Distance > (
Select AVG(Distance) FROM 
Races);

Identifying runners who have exceeded their own average distance can provide insights into their performance capabilities and potential for growth. It allows coaches and athletes to recognize achievements, as well as areas where development may be needed.


#5 Find the name of the training program and the number of runners who have completed it, sort the number of completions in descending order

SELECT programName,COUNT(Recordings.Runners_idRunners) AS NumberOfCompletions
FROM Recordings
JOIN TrainingPrograms ON TrainingPrograms.ProgramID = Recordings.TrainingPrograms_ProgramID
Join Runners on Runners.idRunners= Recordings.Runners_idRunners
GROUP BY TrainingPrograms.programName
ORDER BY NumberofCompletions DESC;


This query keeps track of which people have completed which races. Analyzing completion rates can also provide insights into areas for improvement in training programs. Adjustments and enhancements can be displayed to meet the needs of runners/participants.

#6 list and count the names and contact information of the runners who have a guest count greater than 4. Sort in alphabetical order of runner last name

SELECT RunnerFirstName, RunnerLastName, email, PhoneNumber
FROM Runners
WHERE idRunners IN (
    SELECT Runners_idRunners
    FROM Attendance
    GROUP BY Runners_idRunners
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
)
ORDER BY RunnerLastName ASC;


This query is useful for retrieving  the names of the guests and attempting to increase participation. Listing the total number of participants who brought lots of guests encourages them to return. Knowing names and contact information of runners who plan to bring more than four guests to an event can help the company or event organizer anticipate attendance numbers accurately. 

#7 What is the total number of races each runner has participated in?

USE al_Group_21482_G1;
SELECT r.idRunners, r.RunnerFirstName, r.RunnerLastName, COUNT(rr.Runners_idRunners) AS TotalRaces
FROM Runners r
LEFT JOIN RaceRegistration rr ON r.idRunners = rr.Runners_idRunners
GROUP BY r.idRunners
ORDER BY TotalRaces DESC;


Understanding the race participation history of each runner helps in tailoring training plans and schedules. Runners with more race experience might require different training approaches compared to those who are relatively new to racing.

#8 List members who participated in both events and races.

USE al_Group_21482_G1;
SELECT RunnerFirstName, RunnerLastName
FROM Runners
WHERE idRunners IN (
 SELECT Runners_idRunners
 FROM RaceRegistration
 )
AND 
 idRunners IN (
 SELECT Runners_idRunners
 FROM `Attendance`
 WHERE guestCount > 0
 );

 
Members who participate in both events and races may demonstrate higher levels of loyalty and commitment to the company.Using this information to understand what motivates these individuals to participate in multiple activities can help the company create programs/events to keep customer loyalty.

#9 Find the event type and event name off all events with the number of attendees listed

SELECT EventName,EventType,guestCount
FROM Events 
JOIN Attendance ON Events.idEvents = Attendance.Events_idEvents;


This query is useful to identify which types of events are most popular and successful in terms of attendance. It allows them to focus on organizing events that resonate with their participants and align with their interests.It helps the company make informed decisions about future event planning

#10 Which runners finished in the top ten and at what event?

 Select RunnerFirstName, RunnerLastName, RacerPlace, idEvents, EventName
 From Runners
 join RaceRegistration on Runners.idRunners= RaceRegistration.Runners_idRunners
 Join Races on Races.idRaces=RaceRegistration.Races_idRaces
 join Events on Events.idEvents=Races.Events_idEvents
 where RacerPlace<11;

This query is useful because the best runners attract the most viewers. By tracking top finishers, we are able to better advertise for future events.
